# extract_nuts3
An attempt to simplify nuts3 data extraction using shape file

This code assumes you have downloaded netcdf files (Here we handle daily time frame) and have split them with names beginning with year.
e.g., year2019.nc. year2020.nc etc

The next step is to download the NUTS3 shapefile here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts#nuts21 at 20M resolution

Then run after installing all the necessary libraries
